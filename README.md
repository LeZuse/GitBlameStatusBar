Git-StatusBar: Simpler Git StatusBar
====

[sublime-text-git](https://github.com/kemayo/sublime-text-git) does an amazing job in integrating `git` commands into Sublime Text. However, it is showing too much information in the status bar. This plugin minimizes the amount of text by only showing important information.

Note:

You can disable the `sublime-text-git` status bar by adding the following settings in `Git.sublime-settings`

```
{
    "statusbar_branch": false,
    "statusbar_status": false
}
```
