Git-StatusBar: A more compact Git StatusBar
====

[sublime-text-git](https://github.com/kemayo/sublime-text-git) does an amazing job in integrating `git` commands into Sublime Text. However, it is showing too much text in the status bar. This plugin minimizes the amount of text by only showing important information. Less is more!
